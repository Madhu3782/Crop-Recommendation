# Crop Price Prediction - Problem Statement & Use Cases

## 1. Problem Statement
Agricultural markets are highly volatile, with prices influenced by various factors such as weather conditions, seasonal trends, and location. Farmers often lack access to accurate price forecasts, leading to poor decision-making regarding when and where to sell their produce. Similarly, traders and government bodies struggle with inventory planning and price regulation due to a lack of data-driven insights.

## 2. Objectives
- **For Farmers:** Empower them with predictive insights to sell their crops at the best possible price and time.
- **For Traders:** Enable better inventory management and procurement planning based on future price trends.
- **For Government:** Provide data to monitor price fluctuations and implement timely interventions to stabilize markets.
- **For Agri-Startups:** Offer a value-added service to their users by integrating price prediction capabilities.

## 3. Real-World Use Cases
- **Smart Selling for Farmers:** A farmer in Punjab can check the predicted price of Wheat for the next month to decide whether to sell now or store the produce.
- **Inventory Planning for Traders:** A trader can use prediction models to buy stock when prices are predicted to be low and sell when they rise.
- **Government Price Monitoring:** The government can identify potential price spikes in essential commodities (like Onions or Tomatoes) and release buffer stocks to control inflation.
